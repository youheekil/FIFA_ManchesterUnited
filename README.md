**What kinds of Football players are needed for Manchester United**

#### Introduction 
Okay, my Football Knowledge is close to the ground. But, there are more and more new cases where the Football area performed well with Big Data. In 2016, there was a big change in the conservative Football world from one event. The introduction of VAR (Video reading system) was the one. After the introduction of VAR, 'miscarriage of justice' was reduced by 80%. With that opportunity, Big Data has been used in Football ever since 2016. 
There are THREE areas where Big Data is used in Football. First, Data and strategy analysis effect. Second, Injury prevention effect. Third, the effect of meeting Football fans ' needs through analyzing football matches. In this project, the first area of Big data used in Football, 'Data and Strategy analysis effect', will be performed.
